## Mocked Dependencies

The test suite includes comprehensive mocks for:
- React Native modules
- Expo SDK components
- Device-specific APIs
- Network requests
- Storage operations
- Biometric authentication
- Push notifications
- SQLite database

## Running Tests in CI/CD

For continuous integration, use:

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

This command:
- Runs in CI mode (no watch)
- Generates coverage reports
- Uses limited workers for stability
- Exits with proper error codes

## Coverage Reports

After running `npm run test:coverage`, view detailed reports in:
- `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `coverage/coverage-final.json` - Machine-readable coverage data
- Console output - Summary statistics

## Test Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test is isolated with proper setup/teardown
2. **Mocking**: External dependencies are properly mocked
3. **Async Handling**: All async operations use proper act() wrapping
4. **Realistic Data**: Tests use realistic medical data structures
5. **Error Cases**: Both success and failure paths are tested
6. **Security Focus**: Security and compliance scenarios prioritized
7. **Integration Coverage**: Critical user flows tested end-to-end

## Future Test Additions

Recommended areas for additional testing:
- [ ] UI component snapshot tests
- [ ] E2E tests with Detox/Appium
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] Penetration testing scenarios
- [ ] Disaster recovery simulations

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing patterns in test files
2. Use consistent mock data from `jest.setup.js`
3. Test both success and failure cases
4. Include compliance/security scenarios
5. Update coverage thresholds if needed

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Run specific test: `jest path/to/test.ts`
2. Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
3. Check mock implementations
4. Verify async operations
5. Review recent code changes

## Compliance Test Validation

All tests validate HIPAA and California healthcare requirements:
- âœ… Audit logging for all PHI access
- âœ… Encryption of sensitive data
- âœ… Consent management
- âœ… Emergency access procedures
- âœ… Data retention policies
- âœ… Minor patient protections
- âœ… Security incident detection
